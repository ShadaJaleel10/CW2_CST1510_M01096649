# Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

This project is a Streamlit-based application refactored using Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles.

## Project Structure
- models/: Domain entities such as User, SecurityIncident, Dataset, ITTicket
- services/: Service classes handling business logic and external resources
- pages/: Streamlit UI pages for each domain
- database/: SQLite database

## Key OOP Concepts Used
- Encapsulation using private attributes
- Separation of concerns using service classes
- Composition (AuthManager uses DatabaseManager)
- Domain modeling with entity classes

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app:
   streamlit run Home.py
